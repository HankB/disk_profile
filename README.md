# disk_profile
profile write (and read) performance over time.

## Motivation

This is intended to be a somewhat different kind of disk benchmark. Looking at the results of the Gnome Disks benchmarks, it is apparent that disk performance varies over time as a benchmark procedes. The purpose of this effort is to record the performance through a write (and read) benchmark so the performance variation can be observed.
